        <h2>A little about me<h2>
        <p>
          I arrived in Wellington in November of 2008 from sunny California where I used to work as a machinist creating airline parts. This was done both by hand on manual machines, and also by programming parts in CAD for creation in CNC (computer numerical control) machines.<br>
          <br>
          What is CNC machining? Most people I speak to have an image a factory or an assembly line with a fellow pressing a button, stamping out parts over and over again. Sometimes it’s hard to stress just how incorrect this misconception is. If you’re curious about how cool CNC machining really is, and what it can do, check out this video and be amazed. <br>

          Beautiful. Like watching Michelangelo sculpt. Anyway, there’s not much call for this kind of work in Wellington and I had to leave all my tools behind in Los Angeles, so I went looking for work elsewhere. This is where my banking career started.<br>
          <br>
          My family has always had a big connection to the banking industry, with several of my family members having preceded me through some of New Zealand's biggest banks. Having joined the National Bank contact center in February of 2009, I was surprised how well I did, considering I never had a real sales or service role prior to this.<br>
          <br>
          It was my goal to bide my time while waiting for an IT opportunity in the ANZ, or perhaps look for education opportunities, but my wife approached me and explained that it was her dream to becoming a lawyer. Funny that, it suddenly became my dream for her to become a lawyer as well. So my new-found sales and service skills allowed me to quickly climb the ranks in the ANZ and support my wife during her studies.<br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Late 2014 my wife finally graduated (and yes, they make you wear powdered wigs for one of the many ceremonies involved with becoming a lawyer) and she was able to begin her career, finally leaving me with the chance to pursue my goal of entering the tech industry. I had heard of the Enspiral Dev Academy, teaching people not just development and programming, but the skills to become a great team player in a technological environment.<br>
          <br>
          The school’s curriculum was quite similar to what I had experienced when I completed my training at the National Tooling and Machining Organisation prior to becoming a machinist – an environment submerged in learning as much as possible as efficiently as possible. Fast-paced, action-packed and hardly a moment's rest. This was more like it.  <br>
          <br>
          Now I find myself that much more confident to take on new challenges and more far more capable to exceed.
